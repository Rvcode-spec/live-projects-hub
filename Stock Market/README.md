## Development Approach

The project was developed using a modular and scalable strategy with a clear separation between backend and frontend. The backend delivered secure RESTful APIs with a focus on data integrity, authentication, and validation, while the frontend utilized reusable React components, responsive layouts, and efficient state management to ensure a smooth user experience. Error handling and clean coding practices made the system more reliable and maintainable. Bonus features like AI-based predictions highlighted an innovative and forward-thinking approach.

## Challenges Encountered

Key challenges included configuring CORS for seamless frontend-backend communication, managing database sequences after bulk deletions, ensuring consistent deployment on cloud platforms, and improving frontend responsiveness where response times were initially high. These were addressed through proper headers, automated sequence resets, CI/CD pipelines, optimized API calls, and refined state management.
